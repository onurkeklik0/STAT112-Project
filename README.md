# STAT112-Project
Data cleaning and visualisation


To summarize all the operations we performed, we first cleaned our data set using NumPy and pandas. 
Then, in order to understand our data set, we formulated 5 research questions and plotted relevant graphs using seaborn and mathplotlib.
As a result, it is observed that Çankaya district is the most expensive among these three districts, while Mamak district is the least expensive.
In addition to these, we investigated which variable has a greater impact on price.
From this, we found that although floor had an impact on the price, we thought that the area variable would be more logical.
To investigate this, we compared area and price in Keçiören district and found a very weak negative linear relationship. 
Since it was a very weak relationship, it did not lead us to a definite conclusion. 
Later, when we observed the relationship between age and price variables, we observed that although it does not affect much, as the age of the building increases, the price may decrease.
